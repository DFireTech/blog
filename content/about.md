# About Me
Well, hello! Welcome to my blog that talks tech, Value Blogging 2.0, maybe coffee and metal? Oh, and DEFINITELY open source and Linux. 

## Who am I?
Name's Mick, nice to meet you! I have been around the Open Source land for the better part of a decade and have been daily driving *nix since probably 2014. I decided to make this blog as an outlet to get better ar writing and maybe help cure my writers block. So far, that has helped a bit. It is also an outlet for me to let you guys whats going on in some communities I am apart of! 

My agenda is global dom..... spread joy through community! yeah, that one. 
I hope you will enjoy my stay and send me sats to my hoard!

## What I Am Doing?
I have been the Linux Unplugged mascot dragon for a few years now and let me tell you, its been great. I have broken out of my shell a bit and done things that I wouldn't normally do. Besides for starting this blog, as of Oct 27, 2023, I am also a contributor to Fedora! I have been combing through docs to try and spruce them up.

## How Did We Get Here
We flew, remember? Life has been a crazy ride for a few years. That is the kind of stuff I like documenting!

## Where to find me
You can find me on Matrix as @dmanhaku:matrix.org and @mkittermantgd:fedora.im
You can also find my small business on Facebook and TikTok as Kitterman Creative
