# A Very Warm Thanks

Thank you. For those of you that sent a few sats, it is much appreciated. Even if for a meme or because you believe the dream, it means the world to me. 

Unfortunately, for me, I am more of a thinker and a logistics guy than a super talented coder. Coding makes me want to have a headbutt contest with a wall and see who taps out first. 
What I would ask of anybody who reads this blog is a few-fold:

- Reach out. I would love to know if you have any advice or knowledge to give me a bump while I figure out things like splits (for if I get a guest writer or maybe an interview or something in the distant future) and forms for comments. For now, as much as I have a distaste, I will probably lean on Disqus for comments. 
- Comment! Speaking of Disqus, if you pseudo-boost in, leave me how many sats you left and I will feature it in the next blog post! Note: The amount you leave can be verified on my end, take that trolls!
- If you would like to write a blog post for me, let me know! I am more than happy to figure out pull requests. Since I am on a free Netlify plan, I would have to figure out covering the 20 a month for it, or migrate to a self-hosted solution like a Nanode/Linode
- Spread the word! If you truly believe in the decentralization of many things, lets get this train going!

## What is next?

As of the writing of this post, I am in the midst of setting up the blog node that is ran on StartOS from Start9. I will be getting the BTCPay Server set up on that rig and figure out the routing so that nothing is effected. 
I am also on the hunt for a clever name that would be akin to 'Boostagrams' from podcasting. From my GoogleFu, the closest model for this was Value Blogging, which is only a portion of what it could be. [This post was from 2007](https://problogger.com/value-blogging-a-new-model-for-success/). This could be so much more!

## Speaking of 'Pseudo-Boosts'

The blog was able to get a few sats in! TGBaT brought in 300 sats over 3 sends. Once my new node sets up, I will open a channel and send these sats directly over to there. 
Again, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. 


If you would like to support my work at all, I have a few options for you:

You can use the button and amount below to send up to 3000 sats to my current personal node. This will help me fund things for the blog and perhaps a podcast later.

Not into bitcoin? Thats more than okay. The below will let you either subscribe or do a one-time cash donation.

[Send me an email!](mailto:tgdhaku@proton.me) This will let me know what you all want to see from me. 

Again, thank you for your value. Thank you for believing in my dream.
