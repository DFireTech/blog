# Lets see if I remember how to do this

*Welcome back. Its been a minute or six*

This will mostly be a catching up of what I have been up to in 2024 as I had virtually forgotten a ton of things.

I have gone through a ton of changes internally since my last post most of which are still things I need to work on.

Since my last post:

* Started therapy, dunno if I will want to continue - While it has helped me, I feel that there are things I need to work on before it will be effective for me long term
* Started two podcasts - Just re stood up the infra for this and its mostly all self hosted!
* Ran an almost 5k (2.18mi) and beat my friends and got sick right after with Runner's Flu
* More and more

## What I would love to do moving forward

To get back to my normal, there is a ton of minimalizing I need to do to re-focus. I am still all over the place and its rough on me to keep track.
More and more I realize that all this clutter, whether thats emotional, physical, or anything, is holding me back from being the best I can be. 

I know its late in 2024, but, I am going to do my hardest to get back to basics and doing the things I love

### Until next time
