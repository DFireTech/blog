# *Life* #

Life is difficult. Now, I dont want this to be a, *woe as me, im here complaining again* thing. 
I'm learning as I go and need to learn to handle hard times - even if they seem to come one after another.<br>

I have never been much of a *Perserverance* connoiseur, as I have had a fairly negative outlook on life. 
Lately, it seems that its been one hammerblow after another - get somewhere where comfort begins, hammer blow down, ad nauseaum. <br>

Today was a harder one of these days as I had to take one of my pups to the vet for an emergency visit. 
This wouldnt have been a *huge*, huge thing, but the worry quickly turned to frustration as I allowed the worry to pervade me and let all the work frustrations get to me.<br>

Instead - lets look at what has been a positive force lately in my life and what is to come.<br> 

## *A Positive Outlook Ahead* ##
<br>
This morning, I have taken the first couple steps to redo my education. I blame [TeamLinux01](https://daniel.melzaks.com) for inspiring me to want to do better
A few moons ago, I went to the now defunct ITT Tech and never received help in getting into the tech field. My current aspirations are to be a SysAdmin and possibly a minor in DevOps or coding.
With the lack of help from my former college, I had to use Borrower's Defense to get help with the insurmountable debt I had acclimated thanks to the loans they had me take out. 
Im hoping that this time, I can either do a boot camp or get enough in Federal Aid that there wont need to be a loan taken out or maybe I can get a scholarship!<br>

I also have been fairly successful in getting my infra back up and running! I need to try my hand at jellyfin once more and start reclaiming my library of media once more. Shouldnt be too difficult I would imagine.<br>

I will be getting my resume hosted as a Hugo blog (I kind of have this, I forget where it is hosted at...) but this time it will be more professional looking.<br>

## Speaking of ##
<br>
I am in the market for new work. I havent lost my current gig, but, the burn out is real and I would love to broaden my scope.<br>

I self host, learn quick, and have a deep burning passion for my work - almost to a fault. [Send me an email](mailto:goldendragonhaku@gmail.com) if you would like a copy of my resume!
South Central KS located, remote preferred, and I learn VERY quickly.<br>

<br>
I will be looking to update the look and feel of the blog VERY soon. I like this theme, but, I am in dire need of an update

*Until next time*<br>
*Be kind to one another*
